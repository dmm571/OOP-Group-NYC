We would like to note that we are utilizing the code created by 
Beatrice Trinidad, Johnny Manzano, Renz Sarayba, Chantelle Glowacki, Jonathan Paragas, 
whom had a similar idea and code implementation to what we would like to achieve. All 
code in this repository is a collaboration of their code as well as original code 
created by us.
